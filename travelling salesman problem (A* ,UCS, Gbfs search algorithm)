"""Problem Statement :
A courier company in Chandigarh needs to deliver parcels from a central warehouse to multiple customers.
City modeled as a weighted graph:
Nodes → warehouse, customer houses, landmarks
Edges → roads with travel time/cost
Courier AI must plan:
     Single-destination delivery:
     Use A* search from warehouse → one customer
     Heuristic h(n): straight-line distance to destination
     Multi-destination delivery:
     Use TSP to compute optimal route visiting all customers once and returning to warehouse.
Concepts used:
Heuristic Search (A*)
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Graph Representation (nodes, edges, weights)
Algorithm Comparison (Greedy vs UCS vs A*)
